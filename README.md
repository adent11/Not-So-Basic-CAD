## Sweeps and Lofts
#### Included Files:
Cstick.SLDPRT <br/>
Loft_Tutorial.SLDPRT <br/>

This assignment was the Solidworks tutorials Revolves and Sweeps, and Lofts. In them I made a candlestick and a hammer head using new tools. I enjoyed this assignment because I learned how to use sweeps and lofts while making a model of something real.
