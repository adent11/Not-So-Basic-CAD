This assignment was the Solidworks tutorials Revolves and Sweeps, and Lofts. In them I made a candlestick and a hammer head using new tools.

The most challenging part of this assignment was the flex feature in the hammer head because the pictures in the tutorial were a tad confusing.

This assignment was the Solidworks tutorials Introduction to Solidworks, Lesson 1: Parts, Lesson 2: Assemblies, in which I made a pressure plate and an assembly of a block.

I didn't find this assignment very difficult, as it was mostly a review of things I already knew.
